<p><em>Everyone likes listening to music, but are we aware of what we are listening too?</em>
Depending on what your taste of music is, depends on how it affects your brain. </p>
<blockquote>For instance some can be brainwashing or even damaging or expose you to think youd rather not visualize.
I like rap music ( trap music ) and its not the most.. educational thing to listen too,lol. 
But it releases endorphins and can cause a unusual amount of dependency <mark>Just like cell phones aye?</mark>
Its a my take on studies ive looked at over time. music can be like a drug. your cell phone can be a drug.
